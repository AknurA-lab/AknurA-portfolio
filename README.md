## About
HI, I'm Aknur! I have an education in information technology, I graduated from the International University of Information Technology in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The Bachelor's degree in Big Data Analysis is a unique combination of analytical thinking and scientific rigor in the field of data analysis.

My education has equipped me with strong skills in handling complex data sets, identifying patterns and trends, and translating data into actionable insights. I have hands-on experience with laboratory data, data management, and statistical analysis — all of which provide a solid foundation for a career as a junior data specialist.

I’m excited about applying my skills in a real-world setting and contributing to data-driven decisions that create real impact.
